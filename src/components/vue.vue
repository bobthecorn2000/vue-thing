  <h1>so vue am i right</h1>
  <p>
    One of the core features of Vue.js is its reactivity system, which enables
    automatic data binding between your application's data and the user
    interface. This means that any changes made to the data are reflected in the
    UI automatically, without requiring any manual manipulation of the DOM. This
    makes it easy to create dynamic, interactive web applications that are
    responsive and performant.
