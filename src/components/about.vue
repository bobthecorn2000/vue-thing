    About is a versatile word that can function as a preposition, adverb, or
    adjective in the English language. As a preposition, about typically
    indicates movement or location in the general vicinity of something or
    someone. For example, you might say "I'm about to leave" to mean you are
    getting ready to depart. As an adverb, about can indicate an approximation
    or estimate. For instance, "I'm about six feet tall" means you are around
    that height but not exactly. About can also be used as an adjective to
    describe something that is roughly the same size or quantity as something
    else. For instance, "There were about twenty people at the party" means
    there were roughly that number of attendees. Overall, about is a useful and
    versatile word that can add nuance and detail to communication in many
    contexts.
