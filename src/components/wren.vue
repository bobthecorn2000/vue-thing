<template><h1 class="wren">About Doug Wrenden</h1>
<p class="wren2">Hi there, my name is Douglas Wrenden, and I'm a teacher and headmaster at the Honorable Douglas Academy. I take great pride in my position, and I absolutely love being able to shape the minds of the next generation.
<br>
<br>
In my free time, I have a couple of passions that I hold dear to my heart. One is my Waluigi hat - I never leave the house without it. The other is my Thanos swimsuit, which always draws a few double-takes when I'm at the beach.
<br>
<br>
When it comes to food, there are two things that I simply cannot get enough of: olive oil and salmon. They are the ultimate combination of healthy and delicious, and I make sure to include them in my meals as often as possible.
<br>
<br>
 My dear students have bestowed upon me a most prestigious nickname: "Diablo the Cheater." It fills me with pride to think that my wealth of knowledge and expertise has earned me such an honorable title. Of course, I do not "cheat" per se - I simply have a knack for knowing the answers to their questions before they even ask them. My students' admiration means everything to me, and I am honored to be known as Diablo the Cheater among them.
<br>
<br>
Overall, I'm thrilled to be where I am today, and I look forward to continuing to inspire and educate the next generation.</p></template>
